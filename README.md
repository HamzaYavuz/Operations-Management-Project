# Operations-Management-Project
Sultan's Local Products Shop
This project is a project made to expand the business of a local and small company that exists in reality by going digital. Contacted the shop owner and started selling in the digital market. It has been analyzed that when I realized what was planned in this project, the work increased even more.
